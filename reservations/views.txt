When a user selects a flight on the Departure Flight Page

- Create a temporary reservation, marked with finalized = FALSE
- Select a seat? Or just base the availability off TOTAL SEATS and TOTAL RESERVATIONS?
- What about SEAT CLASS? How to cache requested SEAT CLASS on temporary reservation?

User selects flight and class 
Application creates non-finalized reservation
Application continues to allow the user to select Return Flight if round_trip = 1
Else the Application continues onto the next stage of the process
